*My favorite thing to bake today was baked tomato Omelet, featuring a sunny tomato, eggplant, and mozzarella cheese bake with harissa. Mix it with my green apple cinnamon bread pudding, and you are going to have a fabulous spring meal!*
### Ingredients

* 1 small ripe tomato (about the size of a tennis ball), peeled and sliced

½-inch dice Italian eggplant

¼-inch dice mozzarella cheese

* 2 tablespoons harissa powder

* 4 medium eggs
### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with butter and set aside.

1. Cut each tomato half into four wedges. In a bowl, combine the tomatoes, eggplant, and cheese. Stir in the harissa. Drop the mixture into the muffin tin by heaping teaspoonfuls and place in the oven to bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the cheese is set. Sprinkle the top with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with the green apple cinnamon bread pudding and enjoy!
