*Chicken wings are undoubtedly the winner in the chickpea category. Whether you’re making them in the oven or boiling them with brown sugar, they’re an easy way to introduce a bit of Asian flavor to your plate. They’re also surprisingly flavorful with little effort: in other words, they’re easy to get wrong. With this recipe, which Tita Em calls an Adobo chicken wing recipe, we were able to perfectly replicate a savory, hit-the-spot take on comfort food. The way Adobo brings complex colors and flavors into the meal makes them really shine.*

*Rising star in the short-form category, Tita Em actually launched this recipe from her mother’s recipe collection. “Moms are masters of cooking and of gift-giving,” she says. “My mom still has all the iconic recipes from the past and still loves to create new recipes with family.” With this amazing recipe, she’s introduced a new way to eat chicken wings that I hope to cook with myself.*

*On her lunchbox-plus-toothpaste schedule, Tita Em fills up with creatively simple meals like whole wheat tortillas, tomatoes, cabbage, and quinoa. Her homemade chocolate pudding pops for the oven have become a staple, too. By turning to creative ingredients and tasty recipes, Tita Em took a lot of time in her kitchen and changed the way we look at easy comfort food. Who knew healthy vegan food could be so fun to make? Check out Tita Em’s recipe below.*

*Tita Em’s Adobo Chicken Wings Adobo*

*Servings: 12*

*Cook Time: 10 minutes*
### Ingredients

* 1 boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 2.5 inch pieces

* 5 ounces of vegetarian adobo (8 ounces for 2 people)

* 1 tbsp. canola oil
### Directions

1. 1. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt.

1. 2. Add the adobo and stir to break up the adobo and reduce the volume. Allow the adobo to sit for 30 minutes or until it has reduced by half. Stir it occasionally and allow it to reduce until it is ready to use.

1. 3. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

1. 4. Place the adobo chicken in a zip-top plastic bag. Add about 3 tablespoons of hot water to mix. Seal the bag and let sit in the fridge for an hour, or until ready to use.

1. 5. Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

1. 6. Add the chicken and stir until well-coated in the oil.

1. 7. Add the adobo sauce and stir to coat it, then swirl the pan and brown the chicken on both sides. (You can use leftover adobo sauce to add this to other sauces to create a classic mole.)

1. 8. Remove the skillet from the heat and set the pan aside.

1. 9. Add a dash of Tabasco to the pan and stir until it melts.

1. 10. Spoon the adobo sauce into 12 individual ramekins, then transfer the chicken wing to the ramekins.
