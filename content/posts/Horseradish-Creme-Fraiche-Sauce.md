*An horseradish-infused French mousse gets put in a creamy sauce with poached egg and crispy bacon — if you want to fully embrace this dish, here’s the secret ingredient: horseradish creme fraiche. Turns out not all horseradish is the same, but the creamy sauce just seems the best after.*

*Chefs at the two Manchester Chelsea restaurants, Dame Albert’s and Du Back, don’t mess around when it comes to taking horseradish to the next level, and this takes it up a notch.*

*Horseradish creme fraiche is actually slightly sweetened with orange and lemongrass and gives the horseradish a more delicate flavor. It’s available in a jar for around $2.50. Keep it in the fridge to take up as many meals as you like.*

*Horseradish Creme Fraiche Sauce*

*Serves 6*
### Ingredients

* 6 eggs

* 2 pounds thinly sliced bacon (See note)

* 1 large handful minced parsley, parsley leaves and mint leaves

* 3/4 cup chopped fresh horseradish

* 1/4 cup sour cream or cream

* 1/4 cup Guinness beer or kiragu

* 1 cup store-bought whipping cream

* 1/2 teaspoon sea salt

* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
### Directions

1. Make the bacon: Cook bacon in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat until crispy and cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels. Press lightly with a spatula to separate each piece. (Store any remaining bacon in a sealed airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.)

1. Make the horseradish: Make an immersion blender in a KitchenAid blender.

1. In a large saucepan, combine eggs, bacon, parsley, mint, horseradish, sour cream, Guinness, cream, salt and pepper. Whisk until egg mixture is smooth. Gradually whisk in 1/4 cup reserved bacon. Transfer mixture to a large casserole dish.

1. Melt butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add half of the horseradish mixture, whisking constantly, and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is bubbly and set, 2 to 3 minutes.

1. Pour the other half of the sauce into the casserole dish and add bacon. Top with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, if desired. Drizzle with the horseradish creme fraiche. Serve.

1. Notes

1. For best results, make sure the pan that you’re frying bacon in is flat-bottomed, “so it will cook evenly and crisp the bacon fairly evenly,” says Lindsay Holmes, co-founder of Dame Albert’s. “With a high-sided pan, the heat will linger a little longer, so not as much browning can happen.” On my end, it took a good 20 minutes to cook the bacon thoroughly.

1. Smoking the meat in a smoker is another great way to add that “secret ingredient” to your dish. This cheese-like spread might be easy, but it’s complicated to make: You have to buy some Wisconsin Horseradish Mousse, cook it in a blender until smooth, then blend it again into your sauce. You’ll also need a high-sided pot, a wooden spoon and a towel. I used a heavy bottomed stove pot, and it was easy enough to let the bacon cook.
