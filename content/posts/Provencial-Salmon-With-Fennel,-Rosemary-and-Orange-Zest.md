*A burger with fish seems an odd combination. But that’s exactly what you’ll find in this recipe. Rosemary and orange zest lend an herbal overtone, and cumin and cayenne provide unexpected spice notes.*
### Ingredients

Canola oil, for frying

* 1 whole chicken (3/4 pound each breast and thigh meat)

* 1/2 bunch fennel, root and bulb halves removed, core removed, finely diced

* 2 teaspoons fennel seeds

* 1 orange, zested

* 2 tablespoons cherry or grape jam

* 3 teaspoons lime juice

* 1/2 teaspoon fennel seed

* 2 tablespoons honey

* 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup

* 2 tablespoons olive oil

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

* 2 1/2 cups shredded boneless skinless salmon (filet or loin)

* 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion

* 2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
### Directions

1. Heat a small nonstick skillet on medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of the oil. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and sear both sides until golden brown. Transfer to a plate to cool while you prepare the rest of the cooking oil.

1. Remove the fennel from the fridge. Combine the fennel, seeds, and 1/2 teaspoon of the zest in a small bowl and rub the paste into the chicken. Place the chicken back in the skillet and add 1/2 tablespoon of the oil. Return the skillet to medium heat and cook, stirring often, until cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a plate and discard the fennel seeds.

1. Return the skillet to medium heat and add the orange zest and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of the zest. Add the tamarind paste and simmer, stirring, until it starts to bubble. Add the yogurt and reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the tamarind mixture to the chicken and simmer for another 4 minutes.

1. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of the zest, the cherry or grape jam, lime juice, fennel seed, honey, maple syrup, olive oil, and 2 tablespoons of chicken juices. Gently toss with the salmon and set aside until ready to serve.

1. Meanwhile, to serve, divide the fennel, onions, and parsley among 8 warm plates and top with the salmon.

1. Slice the remaining chicken into thin strips and arrange on top of the fennel. Serve immediately.
