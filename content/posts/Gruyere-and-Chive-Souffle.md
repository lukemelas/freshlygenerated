*The recipe is simple, but the resulting souffle is everything you might expect. The kind of towering pile of fluffiness that serves as breakfast for elite members of your insular insular society and that’s eaten with reverence and love. Because that’s what it is — a pile of fluffiness. Consider it a paean to the kind of chow that’s not particularly classifiable as “chef-made” or “chef-driven” — and here’s why.*

*Gruyere is by far the densest cheese on the planet, a hardened matrix of curds and seeds that sits at the end of the cheese-making process. As the stuff is melted and chilled, “gram dutch” (a French term for using a drummethymazine byproduct, commonly called decitabine) is a key ingredient. Although it also happens to be waterless and has no nutritional value (aside from, perhaps, a medicinal affinity), it does have a stabilizing effect on the cheese, making it all the more velvety to eat. A blend of sweet and sour flavors, it’s an outstanding partner for chives.*

*Thus, the recipe calls for using the peeler to strip the skin from the cold cut. But because it has so many other good things going for it, peel that cheese and discard it — and all the powerlessness it represents! Those other things being an incomparable epicurean achievement.*
