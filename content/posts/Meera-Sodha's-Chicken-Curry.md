*Warm chicken curry is made of fresh coconut milk, heaps of whole or smoked almonds, a few pieces of lime and spring onions, fried and served with a drizzle of tamarind sauce.*

*Curry Chicken With Crispy Almonds*

*Serves 6*

*Active time: 45 minutes*
### Ingredients

* 2 tbsp curry powder

* 1 tbsp cumin seeds

* 2 tbsp garam masala

* 2 tbsp chilli powder

* 1 tsp ground coriander

* 1 tsp ground turmeric

* 1 tsp mustard seeds

* 1 onion, chopped

* 2 tbsp coconut oil

* 1 tsp curry powder

* 1 tsp garam masala

* 1 tsp black mustard seeds

½ tsp fenugreek seeds

* 2 cloves garlic, crushed

* 6 slices fresh coconut

* 500g chicken, cubed

A handful of fresh or frozen unsalted almonds, chopped

* 1 lime, quartered
### Directions

1. Heat oven to 140 degrees Celsius.

1. Sift all the spices and rub into the chicken breast, thighs and drumsticks. Place on a tray and roast for 45 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.

1. While chicken is cooking, prepare the tamarind paste, which can be made any time after evening; an hour or so before is best, depending on the spices.

1. Meanwhile, make the curries. Heat oil in a pan and fry the ginger, garlic and curry powder until fragrant. Add the cumin seeds, chilli powder, turmeric and spices and sugar and cook for 1–2 minutes.

1. Using a rolling pin, turn out the chicken and flake in all the curries. Squeeze in the lime and add the chopped almonds.

1. Cut each chicken into 6–8 slices and serve with crispy almonds and tamarind sauce.
