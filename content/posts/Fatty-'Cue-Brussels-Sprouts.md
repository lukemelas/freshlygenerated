*Hello fat American is here to serve you some Fatty Cue Brussels Sprouts. These out-of-this-world Brussels sprouts are a fresher and healthier take on the classic Brussels sprouts. Add crunch and dark red color to the plate with this recipe.*
### Ingredients

Serves: 2

* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

¼ cup sliced shallots

* 2 teaspoons honey

* 2 tsp smoked paprika

* 2 pounds Brussels sprouts

* 1 tablespoon chopped garlic

¼ cup nutritional yeast (or your favorite yeast)
### Directions

1. Slice Brussels sprouts into ¼-inch-thick ribbons.

1. Heat a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add ¼ teaspoon salt and olive oil and sauté the shallots until they soften. Add the honey, smoked paprika, garlic, and nutritional yeast and cook for about 30 seconds, until fragrant.

1. Toss Brussels sprouts into the sauté pan. Add ¼ teaspoon salt and about 1 tablespoon of the honey mixture, to taste. Cook until Brussels sprouts are lightly browned, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of honey and water. This is what’s called “warming the sauce.” Toss all of the ingredients to combine.

1. Serve with bread, crackers, or a scoop of cooked salmon or vegetable.

1. Enjoy!
