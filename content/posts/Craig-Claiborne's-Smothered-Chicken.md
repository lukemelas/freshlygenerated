*1. Place a couple layers of large white or safflower (sunflower?) cakes on a platter (or use slivered almonds to sprinkle on your platter of chicken breast slices). Spoon over a small amount of olive oil, to decorate the chicken sandwiches. Your guests will be happy to have the bread and butter*

*2. Thinly slice the chicken thighs. On your plate combine 1/2 cup of his(her) bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon of butter. (Or mix minced cilantro, minced chives, ½ teaspoon chopped shallots, a pinch of paprika, and a ½ teaspoon hot paprika powder, if desired.) Pound the chicken thighs into thin slices and place on the butter crumbs-infused bread. Spread the chicken on your plates and dip the tops of the chicken into the bread crumbs. Serve immediately.
