*The Time: Feel free to add gelatine and (a butter substitute called) shortening*

*Notes: The recipe was inspired by a cream-cheese kind of workday morning fave, but you can make the filling for the puff pastries any time of the day. There’s nothing wrong with the process of chilling and icing on top; it’s just a bit more involved than flaky fresh puff pastry.*

### Ingredients

* 1/4 cup milk

* 2 tablespoons butter, softened

* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

* 2 teaspoons baking powder

* 2/3 cup all-purpose flour

* 1 teaspoon salt

* 1/4 cup canola oil

* 3 large eggs

* 2 tablespoons foamed unsweetened coconut milk

* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Whisk together milk and butter in a bowl, or use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, until light and fluffy. Set aside. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt into a medium bowl. Set aside. In another medium bowl, combine oil, eggs, coconut milk, and vanilla. Add wet ingredients to flour mixture and mix just until combined.

1. Spread batter onto parchment-lined baking sheets, spreading evenly. Bake until crispy, about 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on cooling racks 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
