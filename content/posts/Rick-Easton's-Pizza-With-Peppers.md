*Rick Easton's version of this dish uses a Hawaiian pizza crust. This was the dish in which I first thought of Pica Pica, the brand that has taken the world pizza to a whole new level. Crispy, glorious and bursting with the heat of Sriracha, it’s comfort pizza that even pizza haters would have to admit is great for veggies and lentils. I love the powder made by Pica Pica. Made from red pepper flakes, it has a milder spice than the traditional Sriracha. It gives a bit of a kick, and if you’re too afraid to try it, the original Pica Pica plant is now known as the first rooster in Germany.*
### Ingredients

:

* 1 cup crushed frozen unsweetened pineapple, thawed

½ cup kale, finely chopped

½ cup shredded Radicchio

* 1½ cups cooked lentils

½ cup shredded asparagus

½ cup minced green onion

* 4 tablespoons Sriracha

* 4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

¼ cup Olive oil

Kosher salt

Kosher or ground black pepper

* 1½ tablespoons balsamic vinegar

½ teaspoon sea salt
### Directions:

1. In a large skillet, cook the pineapple, kale, and radicchio in a teaspoon of olive oil until wilted, about 3 minutes. In a blender, puree the mix until smooth, then adjust the seasoning with sea salt and either kosher or ground black pepper. Set aside.

1. In a large skillet, heat the Sriracha, lemon juice, remaining teaspoon of olive oil, and ½ teaspoon of sea salt over medium heat. Add the lentils, asparagus, green onion, and Sriracha and sauté until the lentils are cooked through, about 4 minutes.

1. Divide the lentil mixture between 4 individual oven-safe pizzas and finish each one with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar and a sprinkling of kosher or ground black pepper.
