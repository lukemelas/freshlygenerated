*First of all, this is delicious. But let’s be honest, it’s also a little twist on traditional peach cobbler. That involves the use of canned or frozen peaches, which tend to be on the smaller side and not too sweet. So a true peach cobbler must be big, moist and sweet — right?*

*I’ve always thought that if you used jellied fruit you’d get a lovely and very nice taste. Unfortunately, most of the jellies that I have found are too gritty. They’re awful. Something this big, with the traditional crumble topping, needs to be smooth, not rough.*

*But by using lemon juice instead of sugar, I’ve achieved the perfect texture, and also got much more flavor. Lemon juice gives a much punchier flavor and removes much of the bitterness that sugar can sometimes impart.*

*That being said, I know that this recipe is more for baking than for eating straight out of the oven, so a slice of lemon lemon cake would be a perfect addition to toast. But even if you just follow this for the cobbler, just slice it into a cake, spoon some out onto a plate and top with butter and sugar for the perfect dessert for the oven-loving part of you.*

### Ingredients
